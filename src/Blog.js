            <h3>Week 7 & 8</h3>
            <p>
            We have entered the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 
                I am excited to learn this, as front-end seems to be my cup of tea. 
                I really enjoy the design aspect and being able to create from scratch is right up my alley. 
                I am already pondering how to approach local businesses to offer up free website makeovers! 
                This will not only help in building my portfolio but also, I am putting the concepts to good use. 
                I have learned throughout the last 8 weeks that practice is key and one of the most important things you can do to develop your skills. 
                <p></p>PRACTICE! PRACTICE! PRACTICE!<p></p>
                At first, I was hesitant to practice because I did not feel as if I knew enough. 
                My excuse was that I would start practicing when I had a solid foundation. 
                I was simply procrastinating because I was afraid to fail. 
                I will say it one more time in case you did not read it before . . . 
                <p></p>PRACTICE! PRACTICE! PRACTICE!<p></p>
            </p>

            <h3>Week 6</h3>
            <p>Just when I thought I was getting a hang of C#, a new concept is introduced and I am back at square <b>UNO</b>. Data binding collections to control took me out this week. 
                I don’t know what it is about Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), but it is not my cup of tea. 
                The struggle to bind to a ListBox proved to be too much and I resolved to reading every article on the world wide web to no avail. 
                <p></p>Logically, I know that learning to program takes time and that I will always be in learning mode. 
                But honestly, it is emotionally frustrating and exhausting!!!! 
                I find myself thinking of the lab assignment I am stuck on throughout the day, reading documentation nonstop, and watching an insane amount of YouTube videos. 
                <p></p>SEND HELP!!!
                <p></p>Until next time amigos &#128517;
                </p>

            <h3>Week 4 & 5</h3>
            <p><q>Without commitment, you’ll never start. But more importantly, without consistency, you’ll never finish.</q>
            -Denzel Washington <p></p>
            We wrapped up T-SQL and jumped back into C#! While I was excited to get back to C#, I can’t help but think about all the possibilities within T-SQL. Who knows, maybe I actually do enjoy data. For now though I will put it on my list to learn in the future and give C# my full attention. 
            The last two weeks have been tough with learning in full speed. Most of the time I feel completely lost, unable to keep up with the fire blast of information. But, I remind myself that it isn’t a race to the finish. As I continue to study, my understanding of the concepts deepen.
            <p></p>Also, I’ve been thinking about shifting the theme of the blog. Instead of only focusing on MSSA, I will be sharing my journey into the field of technology. So stick around, I promise not to disappoint. I participated in my first ever hackathon event hosted by <a href="https://www.fallin.today/">Fall In</a>. 
            While my contribution to the team conssisted mainly of design (UI/UX), I learned a lot and networked with fellow veterans in the technology industry. 
            <p></p>As anyone who has researched “how to code” knows, there are 9274820294847 different learning platforms. 
            I am all about the free courses and have settled on <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/">CS50x</a> after much deliberation. Week 0 is in the books and I completed my first Scratch project. Check it out below! 
            <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click on the green flag</li>
                <li>Enter name</li>
                <li>Press space bar to begin</li>
                <li>Use the left and right arrows to move</li>
            </ol>
            <p></p>

            <h3>Week 3</h3>
            <p>Microsoft Transact-SQL occupied my brain throughout this week. SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. While it was nice to get a break from C#, I am ready to get back to it! SQL is not my forte and a career in data is likely not in my future. 
                <p></p>Setting up my lab environment proved to be extremely difficult as Azure Data Studio crashed 3947293929 times in the process. SQL is a powerful tool when employed correctly and I see its value in the programming space. I will continue to strengthen my data muscles throughout the course and who knows, I might learn to like it!
                <p></p>On the professional development side of the house, we began to create what I like to call our “story boxes.” It is a place to store information you will use during an interview to answer behavioral questions. 
                <p></p>With the story box ready to go we were able to craft S.T.A.R. statements:
            <ul>
                <li>Situation</li>
                <li>Task</li>
                <li>Action</li>
                <li>Result</li>
            </ul><p></p>
            However, I prefer to use S.A.I.L. statements:
            <ul>
                <li>Situation</li>
                <li>Action</li>
                <li>Impact</li>
                <li>Lesson</li>
            </ul><p></p>
            I learned not to get caught up in the “significance” of the story. Our lives are jam-packed with stories, it is just a matter of uncovering them. So, what’s in your story box?
            Until next time amigos!

            <h3>Week 2</h3>
            <p>This week my brain worked overtime as I grappled with understanding object-oriented programming concepts. Between encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, I didn’t have enough brain space to think about anything else. Technical instruction days are filled with frustration and challenges but, also a lot of growth. </p>
            
            <p>I found myself struggling throughout Friday night with an assignment. I went down every rabbit hole imaginable trying to find a solution. I decided to step away from coding (at the wise suggestion of my husband), to give myself a chance to recharge. </p>
            
            <p>Turns out that stepping away was exactly what I needed. I returned the next day and was able to tackle the assignment within 1 hour. I have much more to learn and I am excited for what is to come over the next 15 weeks.</p>
            <p>Until next week fellow humans!</p><p></p>

            <h3>Week 1</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my blog! I will be sharing short, weekly posts throughout my time with Microsoft Software and Systems Academy. I am enrolled in the Cloud Application Development path. Let’s jump right in! 
            <p></p>
            Week 1 is over and I am still recovering from information overload. On Saturday, I searched for my phone for over a hour only to discover I had somehow left it in the refrigerator. I think my brain decided to take the day off. 
            <p></p>
            Monday - Thursday the program consists of technical instruction. This week we focused on: 
            
            <ul>
                <li>Core Programmming Concepts</li>
                <li>Program Flow</li>
                <li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
                <li>Error Handling and Debugging</li>
                <li>Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            It is alot of information coming at you from all different angles. The key to success is to break the ice with your fellow cohort mates early! Everyone is coming into the program with varying levels of experience. And working as a team will make the struggle less frustrating. 
            <p></p>
            Also, don’t be afraid to ask questions! It is likely that others are stuck and may have the same question. Better to get clarification in order to prevent you from going down the wrong rabbit hole. 
            <p></p>
            The resources I use when I am confused (which is quite often) are:
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stack overflow</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Technical Documentation</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a></li>
            </ol><p></p>
            Fridays are reserved for professional development. We spent the day learning about each other and ensuring various administrative tasks were completed. 
            I am looking forward to resume reviews and mock interviews. 
        
            Until next week fellow humans!</p>
