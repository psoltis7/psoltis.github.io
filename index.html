            <p>This week my brain worked overtime as I grappled with understanding object-oriented programming concepts. Between encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, I didn’t have enough brain space to think about anything else. Technical instruction days are filled with frustration and challenges but, also a lot of growth. </p>
            
            <p>I found myself struggling throughout Friday night with an assignment. I went down every rabbit hole imaginable trying to find a solution. I decided to step away from coding (at the wise suggestion of my husband), to give myself a chance to recharge. </p>
            
            <p>Turns out that stepping away was exactly what I needed. I returned the next day and was able to tackle the assignment within 1 hour. I have much more to learn and I am excited for what is to come over the next 15 weeks.</p>
            <p>Until next week fellow humans!</p>

            <h3>Week 1</h3>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/QMHoU66sBXqqLqYvGO" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/this-is-fine-QMHoU66sBXqqLqYvGO">via GIPHY</a></p>
            <p>Welcome to my blog! I will be sharing short, weekly posts throughout my time with Microsoft Software and Systems Academy. I am enrolled in the Cloud Application Development path. Let’s jump right in! 
            <br><br>
            Week 1 is over and I am still recovering from information overload. On Saturday, I searched for my phone for over a hour only to discover I had somehow left it in the refrigerator. I think my brain decided to take the day off. 
            <br><br>
            Monday - Thursday the program consists of technical instruction. This week we focused on: 
            
            <ul>
                <li>Core Programmming Concepts</li>
                <li>Program Flow</li>
                <li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
                <li>Error Handling and Debugging</li>
                <li>Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming</li>
            </ul>
            
            It is alot of information coming at you from all different angles. The key to success is to break the ice with your fellow cohort mates early! Everyone is coming into the program with varying levels of experience. And working as a team will make the struggle less frustrating. 
            <br><br>
            Also, don’t be afraid to ask questions! It is likely that others are stuck and may have the same question. Better to get clarification in order to prevent you from going down the wrong rabbit hole. 
            <br><br>
            The resources I use when I am confused (which is quite often) are:
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stack overflow</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Technical Documentation</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a></li>
            </ol>
            Fridays are reserved for professional development. We spent the day learning about each other and ensuring various administrative tasks were completed. 
            I am looking forward to resume reviews and mock interviews. 
            <br><br>
            Until next week fellow humans!</p>
